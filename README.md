Hi I'm Saif, 

  

Welcome to my GitHub page! This is where I will be uploading my portfolio project to showcase my data analytics skills. I currently work as a Data Analyst for an IT consulting company. 
I specialise in Power BI through my current role and have develop proficiency in Power Query and DAX as well as data modeling. Within this repository, I will be focusing on developing my SQL skills and creating dashboards in other popular visualisation tools such as Tableau. 

Currently, I have uploaded two projects. The first project is exploring Covid data using Postgres SQL to extract and aggregate the global deaths and vaccinations figures across different continents and countries. 
I then collect my findings to create a Tableau Covid dashboard. 

My Second portfolio highlights my data cleaning skills in SQL using the Nashville housing dataset. I corrected data types for multiple columns, addresses numerous null values, split columns where needed and resolved inconsistencies in column values.  


Thank you for taking your time to read my README. Appreciate any feedback via my LinkedIn (feel free to connect!) Looking forward to uploading more projects in the future and show casing my data skills!  

  

Thanks 

Saif
